						<div class="about">
							<p class="abtme">Hello! Im Josh and I am a third year visual communications design major at San Francisco State University. I originally transferred as Computer Science student, but I eventually decided to pursue another direction that utilizes creativity in the world of technology. This led me to the path of UI/UX design where I can use my design choices to shape the experience of others. While UI/UX is my main focus, I am open to any fields that align with my goals of using my creativity and aesthetics to provide change and helpfuless. Outside of school and design work, I like to keep my creativity fueled, and this is by exploring different genres of music, cars, clothing, my part time barista job, and lastly finding the best places to eat! These hobbies inspire me to stay open minded and how design can truly be impactful in our everyday lives. There is no limit to design, and that is what helps me stay motivated.</p>
