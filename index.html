					<p class="Name">Josh Soriano </p>
					<p class="abtme">Josh is a third-year Visual Communication Design major at San Francisco State University. He originally transferred as a Computer Science student but eventually chose to pursue a more creative direction that bridges technology and design. This shift led him to the field of UI/UX design, where he finds purpose in shaping user experiences through thoughtful design decisions. While UI/UX is his primary focus, Josh remains open to exploring any field that allows him to apply creativity and aesthetics to bring positive change and helpfulness. Beyond his academic and design work, Josh keeps his creativity energized through his love for music, cars, fashion, his part-time barista job, and discovering the best places to eat. These interests continually inspire him to stay curious and remind him of design’s impact on everyday life. For Josh, there are no limits to what design can do—and that belief fuels his motivation.</p>
